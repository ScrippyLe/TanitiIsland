                Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency
                near the airport. <br> <br> 
                Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by
                law). <br> <br> 
                Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton
                Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</p>
