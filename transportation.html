            <h1>How to get to Taniti Island</h1>
            <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in
                Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. <br><br> Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small
                jets and propeller planes. <br> <br> Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able
                to land on the island within the next few years. </p>
