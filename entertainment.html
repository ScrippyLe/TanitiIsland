            <h1>What to do on Taniti Island</h1>
            <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. <br> <br>
                However,
                there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing
                tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery,
                dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art
                galleries, and bowling. <br> <br>
                 Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. <br> <br>
                 Many of these
                activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of
                Yellow Leaf Bay.
