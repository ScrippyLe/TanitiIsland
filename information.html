            <p>
                Power outlets are 120 volts (the same as in the United States). <br> <br>

                Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m. <br> <br>
                The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the drinking age is not strictly enforced. <br> <br>
                Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas, especially by
                the older residents. <br> <br>
                There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual employees. <br> <br>
                Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing
                and other petty crimes. <br> <br>
                Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and restaurants will be
                closed on holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly. <br> <br>
                Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several
                banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
